SPAW Editor PHP Edition
Version 2.0.6

2.0.6 Release Notes

Thanks to everyone who downloaded and tried SPAW Editor v.2! 
Your feedback was extremely helpful.

This release adds a couple of new features like predefined "quick links" in
hyperlink dialog and CSS class field in image properties dialog. It also fixes
a long-standing issue with invalid HTML resulting in content multiplying under
IE among other bugfixes.

Numerous language files were updated and fixed by the community. Thanks! 

For a complete list of changes see changelog.txt 

---
This release includes some language files that were ported from version 1.
This means that some of the messages will appear in English instead of the
language of a specific language file. In case you are fluent in any language
that wasn't updated for version 2, we would really appreciate if you could invest
a little of your time to bring these files up to date.

We will post all the updates in our blog at http://blog.solmetra.com
